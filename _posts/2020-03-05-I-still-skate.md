So yea, I skate, and I also code. Skateboarding has always been my passion and unexpectedly,
it's led to become a decent developer too. I figured my first challenge as a developer should be something
I'd be passionate about..skateboarding of course. Here were the questions I asked myself..

* What software does my phone use? iOS. 
* What language can I use to build an app people I can use? Swift.

And from there, I taught myself a lot of basics with some great resources from Apple and because I knew the basics,
it made learning other languages so much easier. I mainly use JavaScript and Python now but Swift will always have a special
place in my heart.

Over the years, I’ve gotten much better at building software, using different tools, 
and taking on more responsibilities. As I work closely with one of Litt's senior software engineer,
I’m learning a lot about the challenges necessary to provide its users with a the product possible.

In any case, I should probably write more blogs about the tools I learn about, you never know who's going to
benefit from it. Plus, I've read so many blogs(this won't stop any time soon) and it's about time I return the favor.
Stay tuned!
